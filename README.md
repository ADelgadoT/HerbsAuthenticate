# HerbsAuthenticate

The HerbsAuthenticate package process trimmed FASTQ files from both single or paired-end reads to perform sequence mapping against barcode databases. Additionally, it is also able to build customized databases based on the userâ€™s needs by extracting specific barcodes from the trimmed reads.

## Requirements and instalation:
The script requires **Python3** and the following programs to be installed:
- KMA 
- blastn 

To install the package, download the directory. Check the `config.yaml` file and make sure that all the paths to the executables are absolute and indeed refer to a working executable.

## Indexing: 

## Extract barcodes:

## Mapping:
To map trimmed reads against a specific barcode database, the script `Mapping.py` is used. In order to execute it, please follow the steps indicated below: 

1. Create an input file, using `input.txt` as an example. It is a space-separated file in which each line represents the data from one sample. There are three columns: 
    - Column 1: absolute path to forward reads
    - Column 2: absolute path to reverse reads
    - Column 3: sample name 
   
2. Ensure that `config.yaml` is located in the same directory as `Mapping.py` and the `scripts` folder. 
3. Update `config.yaml` parameters according to your data and type of analysis you want to perform. The options available are shown below:
    
4. Excute the script with the following command: 
`python3 Mapping.py input.txt`
